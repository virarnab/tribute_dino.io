<p>This tribute page is dedicated to Dino James, one of the most inspirational rappers from Bhopal, India. I chose to make my first tribute page, dedicating to him because this is the guy who over  the past 2-3 years have motivated the depressed soul  in me to take the hardships put forth by life, to fight back and to win every small struggle, gradually building  up my confidence.</p>
<p>His YouTube channel named "Dino James" has recently crossed 3M subscribers.</p>
<p> As per one of his interviews, he struggled a lot in Mumbai. Later on he went back to his home, when he realized that he has to find meaning of his life but he was clueless. Basically he was trying to do something in acting field and did a few small roles. According to him once he was sitting on a beach in Mumbai, when a guy came with guitar and sat beside him and played some tone. All on a sudden Dino reacted on that music and asked how he did this. Incidentally, Dino was also a guitarist. He mentioned instantly he felt that something had stuck his mind. He went back to his room where he shared his idea with his roommate. Then he started composing something and tuning those, started rapping.</p>
<p>Basically, he didnot do anything extra. He just composed whatever was going on in his life and tuned those and started releasing those raps in YouTube and within a very short period of time, he became the favourite of many, including me and today his songs are one of the most played on YouTube, Spotify, Gaana and what not.</p>
<p>He is my inspiration because he has proved how someone can judge himself thoroughly to extract the best out of oneself.</p>
